This dataset captures detailed lower limb movement data during a 10-meter walk test, which is useful for gait and mobility analysis. The data is collected using two tilebox sensors, strategically positioned to capture a comprehensive set of motion parameters.

Each sensor records the following types of data:

Accelerometer Data: Measures linear acceleration, providing insights into the speed and direction of leg movements.
Gyroscope Data: Captures angular velocity, aiding in the analysis of limb rotation and stability during walking.
Magnetometer Data: Records magnetic field data, useful for determining the orientation and heading of the sensors relative to the Earth's magnetic field.
Temperature Data: Monitors ambient or sensor temperature, which can impact sensor performance or provide environmental context.

The dataset also includes a YAML file containing demographic and lifestyle information for each participant, which provides critical context for data interpretation. The YAML file details include:

Demographic Information: Gender, age, weight, height.
Physical Activity: Frequency, duration, and type of exercise (e.g., walking).
Diet and Nutrition: Dietary habits, portions of fruits or vegetables consumed, daily water intake.
Health Status: Presence of health pathologies (e.g., motor-related issues), smoking status, and current physical state.
Sleep and Energy Levels: Average hours of sleep and perceived energy levels.
Motivation and Participation: Interest in participating in the study.
Mobility Aids: Use of walking aids, if applicable.
